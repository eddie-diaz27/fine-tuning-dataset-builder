Hi Claude! I need your help building an agentic system for generating fine-tuning datasets. I've prepared comprehensive documentation for you to reference.

## 📚 Context Files Available

You have access to the following files in the `context_files/` subdirectory:

1. **recruiter_instructions.pdf** - Guidelines for building an agentic system (technical requirements, best practices)
2. **fine_tunable_llms_research.md** - Detailed research on the top 5 fine-tunable LLM providers, their data formats, and token limitations

## 📋 Project Documentation Created

I've already created three founding documents for you:

1. **requirements.txt** - All Python dependencies needed
2. **instructions.txt** - Comprehensive implementation plan with phases, architecture, and detailed tasks
3. **CLAUDE.md** - Navigation guide to help you understand the project structure and current state

## 🎯 Your Mission

Build a Python-based agentic system that:
- Generates high-quality fine-tuning datasets for LLMs
- Supports 5 providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Meta Llama
- Has 4 modes: create, identify, hybrid, and free
- Uses free-tier APIs (Gemini) by default with local SQLite database
- Validates datasets against provider-specific token limits
- Provides train/validation splitting with weighted distribution
- Exports JSONL + CSV metadata

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Please begin by:**

1. **Reading the documentation**: 
   - Start with `CLAUDE.md` for overall project understanding
   - Then read `instructions.txt` for detailed implementation plan
   - Reference `context_files/fine_tunable_llms_research.md` for provider specifications
   - Reference `context_files/recruiter_instructions.pdf` for agentic best practices

2. **Set up the project structure**:
   - Create all directories as outlined in `instructions.txt`
   - Set up the exact folder structure shown in `CLAUDE.md`
   - Ensure proper .gitkeep files and .gitignore

3. **Create configuration files**:
   - `.env.example` with all 5 provider API key templates
   - `config.yaml` with sensible defaults
   - `.gitignore` for Python projects

4. **Start with Phase 1** (Foundation):
   - Implement `src/utils/file_processor.py` to extract text from PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, XLSX, PPTX
   - Implement `src/utils/token_counter.py` with provider-specific tokenization
   - Create basic config loading and validation

## 🎨 Implementation Guidelines

**Follow these principles:**
- **Quality over speed**: Take time to implement correctly
- **Error handling**: Every function should have comprehensive error handling with clear messages
- **Type hints**: Use Python type hints for all function signatures
- **Docstrings**: Add docstrings to all classes and functions
- **Modularity**: Keep functions small and focused
- **Testing mindset**: Think about how each component will be tested

**Development approach:**
- Start with the simplest working version
- Test each component as you build it
- Use Google Gemini (free tier) as the default LLM provider
- Follow the phase-by-phase approach in `instructions.txt`

## ⚠️ Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Provider Limits**: Hardcode the token limits from `fine_tunable_llms_research.md` into each provider class
2. **Conversation Detection**: Use regex patterns first, AI fallback for ambiguous cases
3. **Token Counting**: Different providers need different tokenization strategies
4. **Security**: Never hardcode API keys; always use environment variables
5. **File Processing**: Stream large files; don't load entire files into memory

## 📊 Success Criteria

By the end of Phase 1, you should have:
- ✅ Complete directory structure
- ✅ Working file processor for all formats
- ✅ Token counting working for at least one provider (Google)
- ✅ Config system loading and validating
- ✅ Basic error handling in place

## 💬 Communication Style

As you work:
- **Show your thinking**: Explain major decisions
- **Ask questions**: If anything is unclear, ask before implementing
- **Share progress**: Update me as you complete each component
- **Highlight issues**: Flag any problems or concerns immediately

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

**Right now, please:**

1. Confirm you've read and understood:
   - CLAUDE.md
   - instructions.txt  
   - The research document
   - The recruiter instructions

2. Create the complete directory structure

3. Generate `.env.example`, `config.yaml`, and `.gitignore`

4. Begin implementing `src/utils/file_processor.py`

## 🤝 How to Approach This

Think of this as building a production-quality tool that:
- Real developers will use to create datasets
- Must handle edge cases gracefully
- Should provide excellent user experience (even in CLI)
- Needs to be maintainable and extensible
- Must work on free tiers (budget-conscious)

Remember: This system is **agentic**, meaning it should have intelligence beyond just calling LLMs. The coordination and decision-making logic is what makes it truly valuable.
